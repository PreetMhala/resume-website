            <strong>Road Sign Object Detection using YOLOV8</strong><br>
            Achieved an MPA value of 97%, which is better than the previously published work by nearly 10%. Wrote and submitted a research paper in Springer Link Publications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Deep Learning in Alzheimer's Disease Detection through transfer learning approach</strong><br>
            Developed a robust deep learning-based system for early Alzheimer's disease detection using a large MRI dataset. Our model, leveraging transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B3, InceptionNetV3, and MobileNetV2, achieved an impressive diagnostic accuracy of 97.42%, along with high precision, recall, and F1-Score. Real-time monitoring and metric logging on the Weights and Biases platform enhance its potential to address critical healthcare challenges associated with Alzheimer's disease.

        <li>
            <strong>Enhancing Strawberry Harvesting Efficiency through YOLO-V8 Object Detection Assessment</strong><br>
            Deployed the YOLO-V8 object detection framework and achieved a remarkable 11% increase in Mean Average Precision (MAP) as the primary measurement entity as compared to previously published work. This enhancement not only signifies a substantial improvement in precision and accuracy but also holds the potential to revolutionize strawberry harvesting by optimizing resource allocation and reducing labor costs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tomato YOLOv8 Optimization Model Based on Attention Mechanism</strong><br>
            Made a significant advancement in computer vision applied to dense tomato scenes. Deployed on a tomato images dataset, this model has demonstrated remarkable performance, elevating the Mean Average Precision (MAP) value to an impressive 92.8%. This substantial improvement from the previous MAP value of 87.8% underscores the model's efficacy in accurately detecting and localizing tomatoes in complex scenes.
